    <h2>Chicago Style Deep Pizza!</h2>
    <a href=""></a>

    <p>And what makes it different from the classic Italian pizza? Thatâ€™s a good question actually, as they have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The look is different, the texture is different, the taste is different. To begin with, a Chicago-style deep dish pizza is baked in a deep dish cake pan (!). It consists of a crunchy flaky crust with edges going up in the pan, and garnished with generous layers of cheese and tomato sauce. Not your regular flat and thin pizza.</p>
