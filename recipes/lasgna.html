                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan <br>with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, <br>cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
                    <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add <br>a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor. </li>
                    <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make <br>from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). </li>
                    <li>Spinach (variation): To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of <br>defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
